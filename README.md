MCE Controller enables the remote control of a Windows PC over the network. It runs in the background on a Windows PC listening on the network for commands. It then translates those commands into actions such as keystrokes, text input, and the starting of programs. 

For example: 

* The command "mcestart" will cause the Windows Media Center application to start. This is equivalent to pressing the green button on the Windows remote control. 
* The command "maximize" will cause the current window to be maximized on the display. This is equivalent to choosing the "Maximize" button on the window's window menu. 
* The command "chars:Hello World!" will cause the text "Hello World" to be typed, as though it were typed on the keyboard. 
* The commands that MCE Controller support is extensible through a configuration file. If it does not natively support a function you wish, you can add new commands easily.

MCE Controller was initially developed to enable integration of a Windows based home theater PC (HTPC) into a Crestron whole-house audio/video system. However, it is general enough that it can be utilized from any control system that supports sending text strings to a TCP/IP port. Most control systems, such as Crestron or AMX, support IR emitting. For many applications, emitting the MCE IR commands will suffice. However, for some installations the reliability of IR emitting and other factors may make IR emitting problematic and MCE Controller offers a robust solution.

MCE Controller can act as either a TCP/IP client or server. When acting as a client the target host and port can be configured. When acting as a server the incoming port can be configured.

MCE Controller runs showing only a taskbar icon. By double clicking on the taskbar a status window is displayed that shows a log of all activity. You can also right-click on the taskbar icon for a menu.
