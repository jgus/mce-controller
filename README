MCE Controller README

The "official" source for MCE Controller is on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcecontroller/

I've put a copy here as a test of github.

MCE Controller enables the remote control of a Windows PC over the network. It runs in the background on a Windows PC listening on the network for commands. It then translates those commands into actions such as keystrokes, text input, and the starting of programs. For example: 

The command "mcestart" will cause the Windows Media Center application to start. This is equivalent to pressing the green button on the Windows remote control. 

The command "maximize" will cause the current window to be maximized on the display. This is equivalent to choosing the "Maximize" button on the window's window menu. 

The command "chars:Hello World!" will cause the text "Hello World" to be typed, as though it were typed on the keyboard. 

The commands that MCE Controller support is extensible through a configuration file. If it does not natively support a function you wish, you can add new commands easily.
